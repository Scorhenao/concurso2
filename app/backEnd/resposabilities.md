# NestJS vs. Spring Boot

### **NestJS** üöÄ
NestJS is a Node.js framework built on TypeScript, perfect for handling modern business logic, RESTful APIs, and microservices. It's great because it's modular, integrates well with security libraries like JWT, and can handle real-time services.

**Responsibilities for NestJS**:
1. **API Gateway**: NestJS can be the main hub that routes requests to the right microservices (including Spring Boot). It also handles authentication and authorization with JWT.
2. **User and Role Management**:
   - Implement authentication and authorization using JWT.
   - Manage roles and permissions.
3. **Order and Billing Module**:
   - Handle the logic for creating, updating, and managing orders.
   - Manage billing, taxes, and tips.
4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Provide RESTful endpoints for the frontend (React) to use.
   - Handle real-time communication if needed, using WebSockets.
5. **Real-time Notifications**:
   - Send real-time notifications to the frontend, like order status updates, using WebSockets.
6. **Inventory System**:
   - While the inventory can be shared between NestJS and Spring Boot, NestJS can manage the part related to product availability and real-time updates.

### **Spring Boot** üå±
Spring Boot is a Java framework known for its strength in enterprise applications and strong support for databases, transactions, and complex backend operations. It's ideal for handling heavy business logic and critical processes.

**Responsibilities for Spring Boot**:
1. **Inventory and Product Management**:
   - Handle the complete CRUD operations for inventory.
   - Manage stock, pricing, and daily updates.
   - Integrate with relational databases (like MySQL).
2. **Menu Management (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)**:
   - CRUD operations for menus, including special items and promotions.
   - Logic to add and modify menus based on the time of day.
3. **Reporting and Analysis**:
   - Generate daily reports for sales, stock, and profits.
   - Provide APIs for the owner to check daily earnings and orders.
4. **Payment Handling**:
   - Handle complex financial transactions like payments, refunds, and discounts.

### **Interaction between NestJS and Spring Boot** ü§ù
- **NestJS as API Gateway**: All frontend requests will first go through NestJS, which handles authentication and then forwards the request to Spring Boot for more intensive operations.
- **Communication via REST**: NestJS and Spring Boot will communicate using RESTful APIs to share data, like inventory status, orders, and user details.
- **Shared Database**: Both can use the same database, with Spring Boot handling the heavier persistence logic while NestJS reads and writes as needed.
